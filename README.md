# HR Data Transformation and Insights with SQL and Power BI

## Project Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis and visualization project on Human Resources (HR) data. Starting with raw data, this project employs SQL for meticulous data cleaning and preparation, followed by the development of an insightful dashboard in Power BI. The primary goal is to unearth valuable patterns and insights related to employee demographics, performance, and turnover, assisting HR departments in making informed decisions.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and encompasses a wide range of HR metrics, including employee attributes, performance ratings, and turnover rates. This rich dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis.

## Repository Contents
- **HR_Data_Cleanup.sql**: An SQL script file detailing the data cleaning and preparation steps, making the dataset ready for analysis.
- **HR_Dashboard.pbix**: The Power BI desktop file containing the dashboard developed post data cleanup, showcasing the analysis results in an interactive format.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: Utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
- **Power BI**: Employed for creating dynamic and interactive dashboards to visualize the cleaned data.
- **Additional Libraries**: Depending on the analysis needs, additional tools and scripts may be referenced or included for specific data manipulation or visualization tasks not covered directly in SQL or Power BI.


## How to Use
1. **Data Preparation with SQL**:
   - Download the `HR_Data_Cleanup.sql` file.
   - Execute the SQL script within your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, PostgreSQL) against your HR dataset to clean and prepare the data.

2. **Dashboard Exploration in Power BI**:
   - Open the `HR_Dashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
   - Refresh the data source connections if necessary.
   - Explore the various visualizations and insights presented in the dashboard.
